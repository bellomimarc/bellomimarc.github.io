The microservices are using the following technologies: Typescript, Nodejs, Java, Go, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, Rabbitmq, Cassandra and Vuejs.  All the services are dockerized and orchestrated by Kubernetes.
I developed a marketplace inside Corvina and two applications:
an OCI artifact registry based on Harbor
an application that handles multiple NodeRED instances
I also developed a documentation site using Docusaurus and an app template generator using Go.
